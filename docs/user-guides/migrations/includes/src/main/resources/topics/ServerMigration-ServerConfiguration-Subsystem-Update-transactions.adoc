= Update the transaction Subsystem

The JBoss Server Migration Tool updates the *transactions* subsystem with the configuration changes required by the {server-target-productName} server.

The update of the *transactions* subsystem is done on its XML configurations, the JBoss Server Migration Tool moves any `path` and `relative-to` attributes found in a `core-environment` element, to a new `object-store` element.

The configuration changes are fully automated, and when successfully applied you should see the following message in the console:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
 INFO  Subsystem transactions XML updated.
